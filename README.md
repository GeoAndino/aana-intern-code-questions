_Summer 2024_

Thank you for your interest in joining the team at AANA for your summer internship. Please answer the following questions to the best of your ability.

## Question Format:
- Pick 2 questions from each section (algorithmic and Python-specific)
- Open each selected question file
- Read through the commented instructions in the file
- Write your code solution in the provided space within the file
  - For algorithmic questions, write your solution in pseudocode
  - For Python-specific questions, write your solution in Python
- Add comments to your code to explain your approach, if necessary

## Steps:
1. Fork this repository to your own GitHub account by clicking on the "Fork" button at the top right corner of the repository page.

2. Clone the forked repository to your local machine using the following command:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/aana-intern-code-questions.git
   ```
   Replace `your-username` with your actual GitHub username.

3. Create a new branch in your local repository to work on the solutions:
   ```
   git checkout -b your-name-solutions
   ```
   Replace `your-name` with your actual name where it is in the format `first-last`.

4. Navigate to the cloned repository directory:
   ```
   cd aana-intern-code-questions
   ```

5. Open the repository in your preferred code editor.

6. Choose 2 questions from each section (algorithmic and Python-specific) that you want to answer.

7. For each chosen question:
   - Open the corresponding file (e.g., `question1.md` for algorithmic questions, `question5.py` for Python-specific questions).
   - Read through the commented instructions in the file.
   - Write your code solution in the provided space within the file.
   - If you are answering an algorithmic question, write your solution in pseudocode.
   - If you are answering a Python-specific question, write your solution in Python.
   - Add comments to your code to explain your approach, if necessary.

8. After completing your selected questions, commit your changes:
   ```
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add solutions for selected questions"

   # Example: 
   # git commit -m "Add solutions for algorithmic questions 2, 4 and Python questions 6, 8"
   ```

9. Push your branch to your forked repository on GitHub:
   ```
   git push origin your-name-solutions
   ```

10. Open a pull request from your branch to your forked repository's main branch:
    - Go to your forked repository on GitHub.
    - Click on the "Pull requests" tab.
    - Click on the "New pull request" button.
    - Set the base repository to your forked repository and the base branch to `main`.
    - Set the head repository to your forked repository and the compare branch to `your-name-solutions`.
    - Click on the "Create pull request" button.
    - Provide a title and description for your pull request, summarizing the questions you answered.
    - Click on the "Create pull request" button to submit your solutions.

11. Once you have submitted your pull request, we will review your solutions and provide feedback.

We appreciate your time and effort in completing these code questions. Good luck, and we look forward to reviewing your submissions!

If you have any questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to reach out to us.

Best regards,
